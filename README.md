# React + TypeScript + Vite

The purpose of this repo to gain some practical experience using Signals in a React app.

The inital commit is code generated using OpenAI GPT-4o mini, with the following prompt.

```
  Create me a responsive react app using Typescript, Tailwind, Prettier and Eslint. The app should be a todo app. The user can add, delete and update a todo. All todos should be displayed in a list with the ability to mark each todo as completed by clicking a checkbox. The total number of todos should be displayed in a header section along with some dummy links to other pages. State should be stored using react hooks (useState) and be persisted to local storage also, every component should have unit tests using React Testing Library
```

## AI generated boilerplate issues

The boilerplate code generated by OpenAI was incomplete

- no styling
- not responsive
- code for components completely missing (required re-prompting)
- code for TodoItem component still missing (used Codeium in my editor to generate)
- no unit tests added
